# API Security

### 1. The Problem: Why API Security is a Critical Business Risk for NaaS

As Lumen's strategy shifts toward API-driven products like Network-as-a-Service (NaaS), our approach to API security must evolve. For NaaS, our APIs are not just an interface—they are the control plane for our customers' critical network infrastructure.

A security failure would have catastrophic consequences, including:

* **Unauthorized Reconfiguration:** An attacker could reconfigure a customer's network, change BGP routing policies to hijack traffic, or shut down critical ports, causing immediate and significant outages.
* **Data Exposure:** A breach could expose sensitive customer network topology and security details, which could be exploited in further attacks.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could use the APIs to launch DoS attacks by rapidly creating and deleting services, overwhelming the control plane and disrupting service for multiple customers.

The core question we must address is, "Can we afford security to destroy our reputation now that we are going with NaaS and APIs?". The answer is unequivocally no. This document outlines the current gaps and a proposed path forward to establish a robust API security governance model.

### 2. Current State: A Fragmented and Bypassed Process

Our current API security process is not undefined; rather, it is spread across multiple teams and stages, leading to inconsistency and a lack of enforcement. As observed by stakeholders, security currently touches five to six loosely connected control points:

1. **API Documentation & Guidelines**: Largely ignored as teams prioritize immediate delivery.
2. **Formal Security Review**: Often viewed as a bottleneck and is frequently bypassed.
3. **Automated Code Scans**: Tools are in place, but their results are often ignored or skipped.
4. **Enterprise Architecture (EA) Review**: A general design checkpoint, not security-specific.
5. **API Gateway Authentication Review**: A final check before publishing.

The primary challenge is not a lack of rules, but that **enforcement has been the main challenge always, not the lack of a guide**.

### 3. Proposed Path Forward: A Phased Approach

To address this, we must move from our current state to a target state with clear ownership and a standardized, enforceable process.

* **Phase 1: Assess and Document**

  Inventory all systems, processes, and stakeholders involved in API security today to build a comprehensive view of the current landscape. This includes documenting complex scenarios like the Lumen partner and customer identity models.
* **Phase 2: Rationalize and Standardize**

  Once the current state is understood, rationalize our various security schemes (OAuth2, API Keys, mTLS, etc.) and establish a single, unified standard for different API archetypes.
* **Phase 3: Govern and Enforce**

  Establish clear ownership for API security governance and leverage automation to enforce our standards. This ensures that quality and security checks are integrated seamlessly into the development lifecycle, not treated as an optional gate.

**4. Immediate Actions and Leadership Ask**

To begin closing this critical gap, we need to take the following immediate actions:

1. **Create a Backlog Item:** Formally add "Define API Security Guidelines and Standards" as a strategic item in the API Governance program backlog.
2. **Signal the Gap:** Reserve a placeholder section in our foundational API documentation to make the need for security standards visible.
3. **Initiate Discovery:** Begin a lightweight discovery effort to baseline the current state, as outlined in Phase 1.

To succeed, this initiative requires executive sponsorship. We are asking the Governance Working Group to endorse this plan and help secure the engagement from senior leadership needed to create a dedicated API Security Standards Workstream.

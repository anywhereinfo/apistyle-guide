This document outlines the comprehensive API strategy for Lumen. It details the core business objectives driving this initiative and the strategic framework that will guide our technology, governance, and cultural transformation. The goal is to evolve Lumen's APIs from a collection of inconsistent interfaces into a true, scalable platform that drives new revenue and delivers a world-class partner experience

Strategic Business Goals (The "Why")
------------------------------------

This API strategy is a direct response to critical business needs. The significance of this program is its ability to fundamentally change how Lumen grows and competes.

* **Unlock New Revenue and Growth** *This strategy opens new sales channels by letting us sell our services directly in **cloud marketplaces** and **expand our reach globally through partners***.The primary goal is to create new, scalable sales channels. The strategy enables Lumen to sell its network services directly where customers are, such as in the **AWS and Azure marketplaces**. It also allows Lumen to dramatically expand its service footprint by using partners as **"offnet provider(s),"** enabling sales in markets where we don't own the physical network.
* **Increase Operational Agility and Speed to Market** *We're **replacing slow, manual processes** with **full automation to deliver services in minutes**, not months, giving us a critical speed advantage over our competitors*. To win against nimble competitors, speed is a critical advantage. This strategy is designed to replace slow, manual processes with a fully automated, **"digital quoting, ordering and activation"** experience. This allows for the **"rapid activation and management"** necessary to displace competitors like **PacketFabric and MP**.
* **Enhance the Partner Experience** *This initiative delivers a **world-class API experience**, establishing us as the **partner of choice** for **industry leaders in the cloud and telecom ecosystems***. We are creating a professional, world-class API experience to make Lumen an easy and attractive partner for high-value companies like AWS and AT&T. For a business that relies on partners, the integration experience is the customer experience. This strategy directly addresses the current **"Inconsistent API experience"** and **"Immature Developer Forward experience"**. By creating a consistent and professionally governed framework, Lumen becomes a more attractive and easier partner to work with for high-value companies like **AWS and AT&T** as well as our Data Center Operator partners.
* **Future-Proof the Technology Platform** *This initiative builds a single, **reusable framework** for all **future integrations**, allowing us to **scale efficiently and stop building expensive, one-off solution*****s**. This initiative is a long-term investment in scalability. It creates a **"framework that can be consistently applied between the initiatives"** instead of building expensive, one-off solutions for each new partner. This solves the problem of **"Low code reusability"** and builds a platform that can adapt and grow as new partners and services are added.

Our Strategic Framework
-----------------------

To achieve these goals, we will implement a holistic strategy that aligns our business, governance, technology, and culture. The following diagram outlines the core components of our approach.

API Strategy Components

To achieve these goals, we will implement a holistic strategy that aligns our business, governance, technology, and culture. The following framework outlines the core components of our approach.

### **Explaining the Components**

* **Strategic Alignment & Business Model:** This is the foundation. We start by ensuring every decision is aligned with Lumen's overall business goals and defining the specific business model for our APIs, including monetization strategies and the KPIs that measure financial success.
* **Execution (Governance, Standards, & Technology):** This is the core of our implementation, defining the people, processes, and tools required for success.

  + **Governance:** This defines the "who" and "how" of our decision-making process. It's a phased model designed to evolve as our maturity grows:

    - **Phase 1 (Crawl/Walk):** Initially, a formal **API Governance Board** will provide centralized oversight. To accelerate progress, a hands-on **Core Working Team** will partner directly with our first product teams to build foundational assets like the canonical data models and URI standards. During this phase, the **Community of Practice (CoP)** will act as a forum for learning and building our "cultural muscle" around these new standards.
    - **Phase 2 (Run):** In the long term, the CoP will evolve into the primary **review 'board'** for new product APIs. This federated, peer-review model scales governance and ensures our standards remain practical and developer-friendly. The formal Governance Board will then transition to a strategic oversight role.
  + **Standards:** These are the technical rulebooks for ensuring consistency and quality across all APIs. They will cover critical areas like API design style, security protocols, versioning, and error handling.
  + **Technology:** This is the architectural blueprint. It is centered on a robust **API Gateway** that acts as an abstraction layer to hide internal complexity, and a **Canonical Data Model (CDM)** that provides a consistent, universal language for our business data.
* **The Result (Developer Experience & Operations):** The execution of our strategy produces two key outcomes: a world-class external **Developer Experience (DX)** with a portal and great support, and efficient internal **Operations** to ensure reliability through monitoring and lifecycle management.
* **Organizational Enablement & Culture:** This foundational layer supports the entire framework. It focuses on creating a true **"API-First Culture"** through a **"Robust training program"** to address the identified **"Skillset gap"** and proactive community building.
